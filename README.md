# Lost
A work in progress Roguelike based on Risk of Rain 2

I will be re-doing the project in a different game engine, as the breaking changes each Bevy update has provided issues.

Though Bevy is an amazing game engine.

# Usage
Here be dragons!

This is a new project of mine, based on Bevy (I plan to re-do this project in Unity or Godot)

To run a server must be present: `cargo run --bin LostServer`, after launching the server run `cargo run --bin LostClient` to start the client
